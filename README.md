# ScanIoT

ScanIoT is a traffic collection tool that provides a Flask-based web application for network monitoring. While it is primarily designed to capture traffic from IoT devices within a smart home environment, it can also be used to monitor traffic from any connected device. ScanIoT operates as an access point, allowing all network traffic to pass through it for inspection and capture.

The provided code is tailored for deployment on a Raspberry Pi, developed using Visual Studio with a virtual environment setup. All necessary dependencies and setup details are listed in the requirements.txt file.

After activating the virtual environment, to run the code use:

<pre> sudo myenv/bin/python3 app.py </pre>
